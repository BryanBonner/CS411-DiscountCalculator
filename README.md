# CS411-DiscountCalculator
## By Bryan Bonner for CPSC 411

### This app demonstrates:
* swipe gestures
* segues
* views
* MVC pattern
* singleton data model

The user puts in an original price, dollars off, discount percent, other discount percent, and tax percent. 
Everytime a field is updated it will update the discount price. 
If the user swipes left they will see the results in a graph form displaying original price, saved amount, pay amount. They may swipe right to view the calculator with the input data still in tact.
